-> In this lesson, you will display compositions on the index page
    -> You will use an unordered list (<ul>) to list all compositions
    -> Each composition will be represented by a list item (<li>)
    -> For each composition, display the following information:
        -> Artist's avatar - Link to the artist's profile page
        -> Date of submission - Use moment.js to show the time relative to now
        -> Artist's username - Link to the artist's profile page
        -> Release type - Display as "Single", "EP", or "Album" based on composition's release type
        -> Title - Show the composition's title
        -> Description - Show the composition's description

-> CSS styling for the page is optional but helpful for making the information readable
    -> Recommended CSS classes include:
        -> .compositions - for the list of compositions
        -> .composition - for each composition
        -> .composition-thumbnail - for the avatar of the artist
        -> .composition-content - for the textual content (date, artist, title, etc.)
        -> .composition-date - for the submission date
        -> .composition-artist - for the artist's username
        -> .composition-release-type - for the release type (italic)
        -> .composition-title - for the title (bold)
        -> .composition-thumbnail - for the avatar image
        -> .composition-content - for the surrounding content area

-> Only show the composition submission form if the user has permission to publish compositions
    -> This ensures only authorised users can submit compositions

-> The index page should display the list of compositions in a simple, readable format
    -> It does not need to be perfectly styled, as long as the information is clear

-> Once implemented, the index page will display compositions with all the relevant details, styled to some degree
